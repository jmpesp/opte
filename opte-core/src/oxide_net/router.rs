/// * InternetGateway: Packets matching this entry are forwarded to

/// actual destination, but rather a configuration that determines how
/// we should NAT the flow.
///
/// * Ip: Packets matching this entry are forwarded to the specified IP.
///
/// XXX Make sure that if a router's target is an IP address that it
/// matches the destination IP type.
///
/// * VpcSubnet: Packets matching this entry are forwarded to the
/// specified VPC Subnet. In the Oxide Network this is just an
/// abstraction, it's simply allowing one subnet to talk to another.
/// There is no separate VPC router process, the real routing is done
/// by the underlay.
